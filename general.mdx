### Step 2: Define Your Question

Craft a clear, unambiguous prediction question that can be definitively resolved.
Your question should have a specific outcome and deadline.

**Best Practices:**
- Make questions binary (Yes/No) or with clear multiple choice options
- Set specific, measurable criteria
- Define a clear resolution date
- Avoid ambiguous language

### Step 3: Set Prediction Parameters

Define the parameters for your prediction market:

**Example Questions:**
- "Will Bitcoin reach $100,000 by December 31, 2025?"
- "Will the next US Presidential election be won by a Democrat?"
- "Will Apple announce a new product category in 2025?"
- "Will any team score over 50 points in the Super Bowl 2026?"

Choose your market category (Politics, Sports, Entertainment, Technology, Finance, etc.)
Set the resolution date and time


### Market Settlement

Markets settle based on the defined criteria when the prediction timeframe ends.
Settlement is done through Perplexity + Grok verification, which:
- Searches and analyzes reliable data sources
- Cross-references multiple information streams
- Verifies outcomes against predefined criteria
- Provides transparent reasoning for the settlement decision

The settlement process ensures accuracy by leveraging both Perplexity's search capabilities and Grok's analytical reasoning.

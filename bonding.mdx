## Bonding curve mechanism

PNP Exchange uses a Pythagorean bonding curve to price decision tokens automatically.
At its core, it eliminates the need for traditional market makers by providing algorithmic liquidity.
It breaks down barriers that plague prediction markets by ensuring there's always an opportunity to buy or sell tokens.
While traditional prediction markets depend on external liquidity providers, PNP Exchange creates liquidity through mathematical certainty.
The price discovery expressed through our bonding curve adjusts automatically based on token supply, creating fair and transparent markets.
PNP Exchange removes liquidity risk by guaranteeing that every market has built-in price mechanisms from day one.
If liquidity is the lifeblood of markets, then bonding curves are the heart.
Creating markets is simple, but ensuring liquidity is critical.

### The Pythagorean Formula

The total reserve calculation follows this formula:


Where:
- `r` is the total reserve (capital) invested in the prediction market
- `s_yes`, `s_no`, `s_draw` are the supplies of YES, NO, and DRAW tokens respectively
- `c` is a coefficient that starts at 1 and gradually grows to account for accrued fees

### How it works

- Automatic Pricing: Token prices adjust automatically based on supply changes. When more people buy YES tokens, the price of YES increases while NO decreases.
- Guaranteed Liquidity: The bonding curve ensures liquidity is always available. No waiting for counterparties or market makers.
- Risk-Free Liquidity Provision: Users can become liquidity providers by buying equal amounts of all outcome tokens, earning fees regardless of the market outcome.
- Fee Accrual: The coefficient `c` grows over time as trading fees accumulate, increasing the total reserve and benefiting all liquidity providers.

### Benefits

- Unruggable liquidity: Creator's initial liquidity can't be taken out until the market ends
- Always Tradeable: Every market has guaranteed liquidity from creation
- Fair Price Discovery: Prices reflect true market sentiment through supply and demand
- Sustainable Economics: Fee accumulation benefits long-term participants

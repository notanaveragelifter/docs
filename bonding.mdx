## Bonding curve mechanism

PNP Exchange prices outcome tokens with a Pythagorean bonding curve—an on‑chain AMM that provides continuous liquidity from the first trade.
Prices adjust smoothly with supply, so users can buy or sell without a traditional order book.
Liquidity is built in, not borrowed from external market makers. We are also exploring delta‑neutral LP strategies to make providing liquidity safer.

### The Pythagorean Formula

The total reserve calculation follows this formula:


Where:
- `r` is the total reserve (capital) invested in the prediction market
- `s_yes`, `s_no`, `s_draw` are the supplies of YES, NO, and DRAW tokens respectively
- `c` is a coefficient that starts at 1 and gradually grows to account for accrued fees

We use a modified version of the pythagorean bonding curve with the constraint that Price(yes)^2 + Price(no)^2 == 1 

### How it works

- Automatic pricing: Token prices adjust based on supply changes. More YES buys push YES up and NO down.
- Genesis liquidity: When a market is created with initial liquidity X, the creator receives equal amounts of YES and NO backed by reserve X.

## Why bonding curves power UGC markets

Bonding curves are a cornerstone of DeFi engineering. They turn market making into code and keep markets usable from day one.
We’re doubling down on advanced AMM design so USER-GENERATED-MARKETS can launch instantly, stay liquid, and scale to any niche.

### Benefits

- Fair price discovery: Prices reflect real demand and supply
- Sustainable economics: Trading fees accrue to the reserve and long‑term LPs

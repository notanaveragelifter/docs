PNP Exchange charges a simple 1% fee on all trading volume across every market on PNP.
This sustainable model funds platform growth while rewarding ecosystem participants.


### Fee Distribution 

**1% Total Trading Fee Distribution:**

- 50% - Market Creators (Direct reward for creating valuable prediction markets, claimable onchain)
- 15% - Platform Operations (Development, infrastructure, and maintenance)
- 15% - $PNP Token Holders (Staking rewards, buybacks)
- 10% - Referral Program (Incentivizing platform growth and user acquisition)
- 10% - Insurance Fund (Protocol security and risk management)

### Why this structure

- 50% goes to market creators, the primary value drivers of the platform.
- The remaining 50% funds operations, governance, growth incentives, and risk management.
- Fees are redistributed to the community that creates value, rather than extracted as pure profit.
- Transparent, on-chain allocation supports long-term sustainability and community ownership.

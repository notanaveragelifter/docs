PNP Exchange operates on a simple 1% fee model applied to all trading volume.
At its core, it is a sustainable fee structure that ensures platform growth while rewarding all ecosystem participants.
It breaks down traditional fee barriers by redistributing the majority of collected fees directly back to the community that creates value.
While traditional platforms extract most fees as pure profit, PNP Exchange redistributes wealth through a fair allocation system.
The fee distribution expressed through our tokenomics may benefit different stakeholders, but it does represent a commitment to community ownership and platform sustainability.
PNP Exchange ensures long-term viability by balancing platform operations with community rewards through transparent fee allocation.
If a platform's success depends on its community, then its fee structure should reflect that philosophy.
Building a platform is costly, but sharing the rewards is valuable.
PNP Exchange makes fees work for everyone.

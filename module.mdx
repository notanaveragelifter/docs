## Market Models

PnP Protocol offers two distinct market models, each designed for different trading mechanisms and liquidity structures.

---

## P2P Markets

Peer-to-peer markets where participants trade directly with each other using the V3 Parimutuel model.

See the [V3 Model - Parimutuel](#v3-model---parimutuel) section below for full documentation on how P2P markets work.

## Pythagorean Prediction Markets

Pythagorean markets use algorithmic market makers to provide liquidity and determine prices. We offer two versions:

### V2 Model - Liquidity Split Equally

The V2 model splits liquidity equally into YES/NO positions, creating a balanced market from the start.

**Required Parameters:**

**Question***
The prediction question you want to create a market for.

*Example:* "Will Apple announce a new product category in 2025?"

**Expire Date & Time***
Set when the market will close and be ready for settlement.

*Example:* December 31st, 2025 at 00:00

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Minimum market deadline is 2 days for other market types

**Initial Liquidity***
The amount of USDC you want to provide as initial liquidity for the market.

*Example:* 2 USDC

> [!NOTE]
> Initial liquidity is split equally between YES and NO positions in the V2 model

---

### V3 Model - Parimutuel

The V3 parimutuel model allows traders to choose their side and includes a maximum pot ratio mechanism.

**Required Parameters:**

**Question***
The prediction question you want to create a market for.

*Example:* "Will Bitcoin reach $100,000 by the end of 2025?"

**Expire Date & Time***
Set when the market will close and be ready for settlement.

*Example:* December 31st, 2025 at 23:59

**Choose Side**
Select which side of the market you want to support initially.

**Max Pot Ratio**
Define the maximum pot ratio to control the distribution of winnings.

**Initial Liquidity***
The amount of USDC you want to provide as initial liquidity for the market.

> [!NOTE]
> In the parimutuel model, all bets go into a pool, and winners share the total pool proportionally based on their stake

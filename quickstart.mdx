## Oracle Overview

A pragmatic, LLM‑assisted oracle that settles prediction markets with verifiable, time‑bounded evidence. It blends multiple AI providers with a strict settlement rubric, and commits outcomes on‑chain when decisive—or safely triggers refunds when ambiguity remains.

- **What it does**: Decides YES/NO market outcomes or identifies non‑resolvable/ambiguous cases.
- **How it thinks**: Evidence‑first prompts that check listed sources, extract specific numbers, and compute thresholds explicitly—minimizing “vibes” answers.
- **Where it runs**: Backs market platforms with an API layer and a Solana settlement module.
 - **Providers**: Uses Perplexity and Grok 4 for real‑time, wide‑coverage retrieval. Their unbiased, up‑to‑date context makes this oracle perfectly suited for prediction markets.

## Two‑Step Workflow

### 1) Criteria generation (filtering and clarity)
After market creation, the oracle generates or validates market‑specific settlement criteria before the market can be made tradeable :
- **Resolvability gate**: Confirms whether the question is objectively answerable by the deadline.
- **Authoritative sources**: Builds a concise list of official or governing‑body sources to check later.
- **Objective rubric**: Clarifies exact metrics (scores, counts, prices, timestamps) and how to compute the outcome.
- **Token/coin markets**: For coin markets, criteria incorporate token‑specific context and data pathways without exposing internal data methods.

Result: Markets flagged as non‑resolvable are safely filtered (and can be routed to refund paths). Resolvable markets move to step 2.

### 2) Settlement (decision and on‑chain finalization)
At/after market end:
- **Time‑bounded evidence**: AI providers are restricted to information available up to the market’s deadline.
- **Source‑checking**: The oracle checks the pre‑listed resolution sources first. It extracts the numbers/facts that resolve the question.
- **Explicit computation**: Shows the math or threshold logic (e.g., totals, comparisons), then decides YES/NO—or returns ambiguous only if truly unverifiable.
- **Consensus mode (optional)**: Multiple providers can be queried; if they agree, we finalize with higher confidence. If they conflict, we prefer authoritative sources and fall back safely.
- **Finalization**: When decisive, the on‑chain module commits the result; when ambiguous/non‑resolvable, a dispute path is enabled.

## Why This Oracle Gets Markets Right

Purpose‑built for prediction markets where clarity, deadlines, and fairness matter most.

- **Evidence‑first prompting**: Requires checking the listed sources, extracting exact values, and doing the calculation explicitly—not just summarizing news.
- **Time‑bounded lookups**: Date filters prevent leakage from after‑deadline information.
- **Authoritative‑source precedence**: Official databases and governing bodies outrank general reporting. Conflicts use a clear precedence policy.
- **Deterministic rubric**: Criteria define what counts, how to count it, and how to compare it—before any decision is made.
- **Multi‑provider optionality**: Uses multiple AI providers and can require agreement to reduce single‑model bias.

## Operational Flow

- **Before end time**
  - Run criteria generation for a batch of markets.
  - Mark resolvable vs. non‑resolvable and store resolution sources.
- **At/after end time**
  - Execute settlement analysis with time‑bounded evidence.
  - If decisive, finalize on‑chain; otherwise, enable refunds.
- **Admin safety**
  - Sensitive write actions are gated; emergency refund flows are supported.
  - Many test endpoints are disabled in production.

## Non‑Technical Pitch

- **Fair and transparent**: Decisions cite sources and show the arithmetic behind the outcome.
- **Deadline‑honoring**: Uses information available before the market closes—no hindsight bias.
- **Robust and pragmatic**: Human‑like reasoning that behaves like a careful adjudicator, not a chatbot.
- **Multi‑model resilience**: Optional consensus reduces brittleness; disagreements trigger safe fallbacks.
- **On‑chain finality with safety nets**: When clear, we settle; when unclear, refunds are enabled fast.

## Oracle Roadmap

- Ongoing upgrades to criteria templates, source‑precedence policies, and time‑bounded retrieval.
- Expanding support for more market types: token/coin price markets, sports, politics, social/media events, on‑chain protocol events, and custom rubric‑defined questions.
- Deeper integration with Perplexity and Grok 4, plus additional MCP connectors for domain‑specific evidence.
- Path to decentralization: optional operator network reaching consensus prior to finalization.

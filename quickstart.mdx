## Oracle functionning

Our oracle system is built for permissionless settlement
PNP Exchange categorizes prediction markets by how they settle their outcomes.
At its core, it separates markets into two distinct types: Price Markets and Twitter Markets.
It eliminates third-party dependencies by implementing specialized settlement modules for each market type.
While traditional prediction markets rely on external optimistic providers, PNP Exchange settles outcomes through programmatic on-chain logic and AI-powered analysis.
The settlement mechanism expressed through our dual approach ensures accurate outcomes while maintaining decentralization and preventing manipulation.
PNP Exchange removes bottlenecks by automating settlement processes through smart contracts and off-chain AI models.
If settlement is the backbone of prediction markets, then automation is its strength.
Creating trust is complex, but executing settlement should be simple.
PNP Exchange makes oracles work autonomously.

### Market types

#### Price Markets
Markets that settle based on token price data.

Settlement process:
- Target price and deadline stored on-chain during creation
- Settlement module fetches market parameters automatically
- Current price retrieved from high-liquidity on-chain pools
- Winning outcome determined by price comparison
- No human intervention required

Example: "Will BTC reach $85k by end of January?"

#### Twitter and Question Markets
Markets that settle based on social media data and real-world events.

Settlement Process:
- Market question, trusted Twitter username, and deadline stored on-chain
- Anyone can call initSettlement(conditionId) after deadline
- AI model analyzes tweets from specified trusted source
- Structured prompt combines market question with tweet data
- Model outputs definitive "YES" or "NO" response
- Result submitted on-chain to settle market

Example: "Will Vitalik appear on Joe Rogan's podcast by January 2025?"

### Token System
All market outcomes are minted as ERC1155 tokens with unique IDs:
- YES tokens: keccak256(conditionId + "YES")
- NO tokens: keccak256(conditionId + "NO") 

### Future Development
We're building a decentralized network of operators running settlement models with BLS-signed responses backed by staked value, further enhancing security and decentralization.

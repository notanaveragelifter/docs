### Step 4: Set Your Prediction Question

Craft your prediction question based on the tweet's metrics. Here are some example questions:

**Example Questions:**
- "Will this tweet reach 10,000 likes or more by February 5, 2026?"
- "Will this tweet get retweeted 5,000 times or more by the end of this week?"
- "Will the tweet impressions exceed 1 million within the next 48 hours?"

Choose what to predict about the tweet - likes, retweets, replies, impressions, or engagement rate.
Select a timeframe for your prediction - end of hour, day, week, or month.
Uses Twitter API to fetch the latest engagement metrics and real-time data.


### Market Settlement

Markets automatically settle using our Twitter API integration when the prediction timeframe ends.
After settlement, the system verifies the outcome by checking the actual engagement data and metrics for the tweet.
The settlement process ensures accuracy by cross-referencing multiple data points from Twitter API.

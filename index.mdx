## Introduction

PNP Exchange is a decentralized prediction market protocol that revolutionizes how we bet on the future.
At its core, it is a permissionless platform that enables users to create and trade on prediction markets for any real-world event.
It breaks down traditional barriers in prediction markets by eliminating the need for order books and allowing people with skin in the game to express real-time sentiment around events through bonding curves.
While traditional prediction markets suffer from liquidity issues and require market makers, PNP Exchange propagates trading through the power of automated market making.
The dynamic pricing expressed through bonding curves may not represent absolute truth, but it does represent a real-time data point that increases in accuracy as more people participate in these markets.
PNP Exchange exposes the real-time sentiment behind events and fosters the search for truth by resolving prediction markets through decentralized oracles.
If a prediction market is a truth machine, then its "truth" is only as good as its accessibility and liquidity.
Creating a market is easy, but finding the right price is priceless.
PNP Exchange makes markets on everything.

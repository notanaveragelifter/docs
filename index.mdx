## Protocol Overview

PNP Exchange is a decentralized prediction market protocol deployed on Solana that enables permissionless creation, trading, and settlement of prediction markets for real-world events. The protocol implements an automated market maker (AMM) model using bonding curves to provide continuous liquidity and price discovery.

## Architecture

### Core Components

**Market Creation**: Permissionless deployment of prediction markets with configurable parameters including question, end time, and initial liquidity.

**Bonding Curve AMM**: Continuous pricing mechanism using Pythagorean bonding curves that eliminates the need for order books and provides instant liquidity.

**Oracle Settlement**: Decentralized resolution system using LLM-assisted oracles that evaluate structured evidence and time-bounded data to determine market outcomes.

**Token Economics**: Fair launch tokenomics with 100% community distribution and transparent fee structure.

### Technical Specifications

- **Network**: Solana mainnet-beta
- **Collateral Token**: USDC (EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v)
- **Trading Fee**: 1% on all transactions
- **Settlement**: LLM-assisted oracles with structured evidence evaluation
- **Liquidity Model**: Pythagorean bonding curves with automatic price discovery

## Key Features

- **Permissionless Market Creation**: No approval process or gatekeepers
- **Continuous Liquidity**: Bonding curves provide liquidity from first trade
- **Decentralized Settlement**: LLM oracles with transparent evidence evaluation
- **Composable Architecture**: Open protocol for integration with DeFi infrastructure
- **Fair Launch**: 100% community token distribution with no team allocation

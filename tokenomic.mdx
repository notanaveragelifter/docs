## Tokenomics

PNP Exchange launched with a fair launch model that ensures true community ownership.
At its core, it represents a commitment to decentralization with zero team allocation and no reserved tokens.
It breaks away from traditional token launches by ensuring every token was available to the community from day one.
While most projects allocate significant portions to teams and investors, PNP Exchange distributed 100% of tokens through fair market mechanisms.
The distribution method expressed through our launch philosophy ensures that no single entity has unfair advantages or control.
PNP Exchange launched on Believe.app, a crypto launchpad that lets users create and launch tokens directly through ùïè, without needing a crypto wallet or any technical setup.
If token distribution defines project ethos, then fair launch defines true decentralization.
Building for the community means launching with the community.
PNP Exchange makes tokenomics fair for everyone.

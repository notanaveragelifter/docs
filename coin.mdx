### Step 4: Set Your Prediction Question

Craft your prediction question based on the coin's metrics. Here are some example questions:

**Example Questions:**
- "Will this token see its total liquidity rise to $500K or more by February 5, 2026?"
- "Will the token price reach $1.00 or higher by the end of this month?"
- "Will the market cap exceed $10M within the next 7 days?"

Choose what to predict about the coin - price targets, percentage changes, liquidity milestones, or market cap goals.
Select a timeframe for your prediction - end of hour, day, week, or month.
Uses Birdeye API to fetch the latest forecast and real-time market data.


### Market Settlement

Markets automatically settle using our Birdeye API integration when the prediction timeframe ends.
After settlement, the system verifies the outcome by checking the actual price data and market conditions for the coin.
The settlement process ensures accuracy by cross-referencing multiple data points from Birdeye API.

### —> Creator fees

Creators earn 50% of the 1% trading fee their markets generate. As participants trade on the bonding curve, a share of volume accrues to the market creator—rewarding high‑quality markets and ongoing curation.

- 1% fee on buys and sells
- Earnings scale with market engagement
- Transparent on-chain accrual


### —> Permissionless launches
Launch a market in seconds with a Solana wallet and USDC—no listings, no approvals. Markets become tradeable immediately after creation.

### —> LLM Oracle settlement

Markets settle via structured, real‑time LLM evaluation—no token‑weighted dispute votes or third‑party resolution councils. Models analyze on‑chain parameters and curated off‑chain evidence (e.g., price feeds, official accounts, articles) to produce deterministic YES/NO outcomes that anyone can submit on‑chain.

- Reduces manipulation risk from whale voting
- Programmatic evidence collection and auditability
- Permissionless settlement after deadlines

### —> Prediction Market DEX Launchpad 

Launch a prediction market on any topic: state the question, and our AI helps derive resolvability criteria. PNP bundles market creation, curve‑based trading, and oracle settlement into a single, seamless protocol—no external order book, no third‑party disputes, no manual hand‑offs.


- One flow: create → trade → earn
- Unified UX for creators, traders, and resolvers
- On-chain primitives designed to compose together


 

### —No off-chain orderbook

All trading uses an on‑chain bonding curve. Prices adjust continuously with supply—so you can always buy or sell outcome tokens without needing counterparties or an order book.

- Bonding‑curve AMM (parameters iterate over time)
- Predictable pricing mechanics
- Works even for long-tail, niche markets

### 🌊 Bonding Curve Liquidity

**Guaranteed liquidity for every market**

Our Pythagorean bonding curve ensures that every prediction market has built-in liquidity from the moment it's created. No need to wait for market makers or worry about thin order books.

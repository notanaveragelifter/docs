- Total Value Locked changes for specific protocols
- Cross-chain TVL comparisons
- DeFi sector TVL growth predictions
- Protocol-specific TVL milestones

**Market Cap Predictions**
- DeFi token market capitalization forecasts
- Protocol token value predictions
- Market cap growth percentage targets

**Outflow Analysis**
- Daily protocol outflows monitoring
- Token outflow trend predictions
- Protocol liquidity change forecasts

## Supported Data Sources

**DeFiLlama API Integration**
- Real-time TVL data from DeFiLlama
- Historical performance metrics
- Protocol-specific analytics

**Market Data Providers**
- Token price feeds from multiple exchanges

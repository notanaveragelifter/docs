### DeFi Protocol Predictions

Predictions based on DeFi protocol performance, TVL changes, and market metrics.
Settlement: DeFiLlama API + LLM


### Step 1: Choose Your Market Type

Select "DefiLlama Markets" from the available market types to create DeFi protocol-based prediction markets.

### Step 2: Select DeFi Protocol

Search and select the DeFi protocol you want to create a market for.
The interface will show matching protocols with their category and current TVL.

**Example:**
- Search for "Lido"
- See: **Lido** - Liquid Staking, TVL: $27.5B
- Select the protocol to proceed

### Step 3: Select Metric

Choose the specific metric you want to predict for the selected protocol:

**Available Metrics:**
- **TVL** - Total Value Locked in the protocol
- **Market Cap** - Protocol market capitalization
- **Outflows** - Token outflows from the protocol

The selected protocol information (name, category, and current TVL) will be displayed for confirmation.

### Step 4: Set Your Prediction Question

Craft your prediction question based on the protocol's metrics. Here are some example questions:

**Example Questions:**
- "Will Lido's TVL reach $30 billion or more by February 5, 2026?"
- "Will the protocol's Market Cap exceed $5 billion by the end of this quarter?"
- "Will token outflows from the protocol surpass $500 million within the next 30 days?"

Choose what to predict about the protocol based on your selected metric - TVL, Market Cap, or Outflows.
Select a timeframe for your prediction - end of day, week, month, or quarter.
Uses DefiLlama API to fetch the latest protocol data and real-time metrics.


### Market Settlement

Markets automatically settle using our DefiLlama API integration combined with LLM verification when the prediction timeframe ends.
After settlement, the system verifies the outcome by checking the actual protocol metrics (TVL, Market Cap, or Outflows).
The settlement process ensures accuracy by cross-referencing data from DefiLlama API and using LLM to validate the results.



### Popular Use Cases

- Predicting TVL milestones for emerging protocols
